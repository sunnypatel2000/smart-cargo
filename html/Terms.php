				                    applications we offer (collectively the “Services”). All capitalized terms used but not defined
				                    herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the accompanying Tinsle Terms and
				                    Conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
				            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tinsle takes your privacy seriously and has implemented internal policies
				                with that in mind. We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you
				                register to access the Site and/or the Mobile Application and use the Services, through your user
				                account (your “Account”); (ii) if you use some of the Services generally without registering; (iii)
				                if you access the Mobile Application and/or Site from third party websites and services; and (iv) if
				                you visit the Site. When you access the Site and/or Mobile Application or use the Services, you are
				                consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your
				                information as described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
				            <p><b>What Is Covered In Our Privacy Policy?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span
				                    style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable
				                    information (“Personal Information”) gathered when you are accessing the Site and/or Mobile
				                    Application or using the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal
				                    Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business
				                    partners.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This
				                    Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control,
				                    including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications, including those of
				                    credit card payment processors (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Site
				                    and/or Mobile Application or in connection with the use of the Services [or to individuals that we
				                    do not manage or employ]. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services
				                    that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy
				                    policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of
				                    any Third Party Services you access.</span></p>
				            <p><b>What Information is collected?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span
				                    style="font-weight: 400;">The information we gather enables us to personalize or tailor the
				                    experience for our Users, tippers and other Consumers. In connection with certain aspects of the
				                    Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the
				                    following types of information from our Users and Service Providers.</span></p>
				            <p><b>My Account/Personal Information:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span
				                    style="font-weight: 400;">When you create an Account, you will provide information that could be
				                    Personal Information, such as contact data: name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number,
				                    email address and other information that account Users’ and/or Lawyers’ provide. You acknowledge
				                    that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account on the Site and/or Mobile
				                    Application and/or using the Services, you are providing Personal Information to us, which allow
				                    others, including us, to identify you and therefore you may not be anonymous.&nbsp;</span></p>
				            <p><b>User Content:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some
				                    features of the Services allow you to provide information so that we can better provide the
				                    Services, such as description of legal needs to be sent by Users to tippers registered with Tinsle.
				                    This information will be sent to a tipper or tippers as requested by you before your tipping
				                    endeavor. We may retain all information submitted by you to access the Site and/or Mobile
				                    Application and the Services indefinitely, even after you terminate your Account. We may continue to
				                    disclose such information to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as
				                    described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
				            <p><b>Financial Information:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span
				                    style="font-weight: 400;">For Users, we do not collect any financial information, as the Services
				                    are free. For our registered Service Providers, we do collection financial information. The
				                    information is collected and stored by our third party payment processing company (the “Payment
				                    Processor”), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s
				                    applicable terms of service and privacy policy.&nbsp;</span></p>
				            <p><b>Traffic Data:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We
				                    automatically receive and record information from Users, tippers, and other Consumers who visit our
				                    Site and/or Mobile Application, such as your IP address, browser settings, mobile device type,
				                    Internet service provider (ISP), operating system and date/time stamps. This information is used for
				                    fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data and to compile traffic data and
				                    referring sources.&nbsp;</span></p>
				            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use this information to analyze site data/traffic but the information
				                    is not examined from a personal identification source or information. It’s also used to diagnose
				                    problems with operating systems and servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
				            <p><b>Email Communications:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span
				                    style="font-weight: 400;">You may receive a new user email from us, password reset email and/or
				                    related marketing emails no more than two per month.&nbsp;</span></p>
				            <p><b>Cookies: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies are
				                    pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a
				                    website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use
				                    standard cookie features with major browser applications, mobile devices and third parties such as
				                    Google Analytics and Flurry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span
				                    style="font-weight: 400;">Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do
				                    not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to
				                    tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser or
				                    mobile browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your
				                    Account if you have one.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span
				                    style="font-weight: 400;">You can remove cookies by provided by your Internet browser’s “help” or
				                    “support” directory. If you reject cookies or have them turned off you can still use our web site
				                    and mobile application.&nbsp;</span></p>
				            <p><b>Service Providers</b></p>
				            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other
				                    businesses that we believe to be trustworthy and have privacy practices consistent with ours,
				                    including our affiliates (“</span><b>Service Providers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”). For
				                    example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and
				                    maintenance, payment processing, data storage and management, marketing and promotions and customer
				                    research/analytics. We only provide our Service Providers with the information necessary for them to
				                    perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security
				                    procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect
				                    your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Service Providers are
				                    prohibited from using or disclosing Personal Information other than as specified by
				                    Tinsle.&nbsp;</span></p>
				            <p><b>Web Beacons:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use
				                    from time to time web beacons to help us track referrals from our business partners and affiliates.
				                    This function is very similar to a cookie and used to track movements of the web user. We do not tie
				                    information gathered to our tippers and service providers with Personal Information.&nbsp;</span>
				            </p>
				            <p><b>How Is Your Information Shared and/or Used?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span

				                    addition, we might send “how to use” or “training” information, related to how to use our mobile

				                    user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or
				                    substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy,
				                    user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You
